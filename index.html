	<h1>Bailey Sarian</h1>
	<p> The first Youtuber I will be talking about is a lady named Bailey Sarian. She is a 31 year old, who makes videos about murder cases, while doing her makeup. She likes to call it “Muder Mystery and Makeup Monday”, since she uploads videos every monday. She is a big fan of murder stories so she decided to make a channel where she can do the two things she loves. She goes into this in-depth investigation to gather as many information as she can, about the specific topic she will be discussing during her weekly videos. Then she proceeds to explain everything from the very beginning of how the story starts to finish, while providing photos, names, and ohter informstion that will be useful for the audience to get a better viusla representation.</p>

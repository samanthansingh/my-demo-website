	<h1>The Odd1sOut</h1>
	<p> Next up is this youtube channel called The Odd1sout, he is 24 years old and he does animation. Sadly he doesn't normally show his face, but we are about to see how he looked wiht hs face reveal video a couple years back. He specialized in telling real life stories about himself. I would say that he is very open about himself and isn't afriad to talk about situations in his life, for example when he talked about dropping out of college to become a youtuber, even thought that may Youtubers do this, it is still a tuff subject for others to be open about doing this. Since becoming a Youtuber, isn't an "ideal job" in many poeples eyes. but even so he creates alot of content, and is  dedicated in what he does, never missing a day to upload a new video for his viewers. To name a few things he talks about in his channel are:
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>His job experiences</li>
					<li>Things he likes and dislikes</li>
					<li>talking about his school experinces/ dropping out of college</li>
					<li>Good/Bad experiences</li>
				</ul>
			</nav>
		there are many topics in his channel. Whether it is a completely different subject or an ongoing or relateable video for his recent videos. He is able to connect with many of his subscribers, especially since most of them are much younger then he is but he is a very diverse person that create content for all ages to watch and child friendly. Even thought it isnt like a channel when you can show yourself in the camrera, he is still able to impact people with his animations, funny stories, relatable topics, and dedication to his work.</p>

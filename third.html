	<h1>Mr. Nightmare</h1>
	<p> Last but not least, one of my favourite youtube channel of all times is Mr. Nightmare. His whole youtube channel is based on telling horror stories, whether it is made up or true stories. Even thought this is all through the internet, somehow he's able to make us feel like we were there during the incident. His voice suits this horror story theme, because it is deep and raspy and also the background noises and images, making the stories sound scary when hearing it. It's even better when they add animations for his videos, allowing you to see a visual of how they stories go, but I personally like when I can use my imagination from his picture slides. I would definitely recommend Mr. Nightmare if you want something to listen to at night, whether you like falling alseep to someone talking or or to stay up late, because you want to get scared (surpisingly some poeple like that) or want something that to pass time. </p>
